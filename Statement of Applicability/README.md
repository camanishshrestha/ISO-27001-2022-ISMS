## My Point of View (POV)

As the ISMS Lead, I prepared this **Statement of Applicability (SOA)** to demonstrate a practical approach for implementing ISO/IEC 27001:2022 at **Bini IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd.**. This project reflects my understanding of information security management and how controls are applied in real-world scenarios.  

The SOA is not just a checklist; it is a **reflection of my methodology**, showing how I:  

1. **Mapped controls to the organization** – I reviewed all ISO 27001:2022 controls and determined which are applicable to our IT infrastructure, cloud services, software development, and business operations.  
2. **Assessed implementation status** – I categorized controls as Implemented, Partial, Planned, or Not Applicable, documenting the reasoning behind each.  
3. **Justified exclusions** – For controls that were out of scope, I explained alternative measures or mitigation strategies.  
4. **Linked risks to controls** – I mapped organizational risks to the relevant controls, demonstrating proactive risk management.  
5. **Documented evidence references** – Each control includes notes on policies, procedures, or logs that support implementation.  
6. **Randomized numbers for learning** – For portfolio purposes, the numbers in Total, Applicable, Excluded, Implemented, Partial, and Planned controls have been randomized to create a fully unique SOA example.  

This SOA reflects my **hands-on perspective** on how ISMS can be implemented practically, highlighting both strengths and areas needing improvement.

## How I Approached the SOA

1. **Analyzed ISO 27001:2022 standard** to identify control requirements relevant to the company scope.  
2. **Reviewed organizational structure, IT systems, and processes** to determine applicability of each control.  
3. **Assigned status to each control** (Implemented, Partial, Planned, or N/A) based on my observations and ISMS maturity.  
4. **Documented justifications and evidence references** for every control to demonstrate compliance readiness.  
5. **Mapped risks to controls** to show traceability and proactive risk mitigation.  
6. **Prepared tables and summaries** to clearly visualize the ISMS coverage across Organizational, People, Physical, and Technological domains.

- Applying control assessments and justifying implementation decisions.  
- Linking organizational risks to controls for clear traceability.  
- Creating structured documentation suitable for audits, training, and portfolio presentation.  

This SOA is **my personal learning portfolio**, showing my ability to implement, assess, and document an ISMS from scratch.
